// A simple AccessManager in which user IP is mapped offchain to a geolocation and then whitelisted user status is stored in the contract.
// If geographic regions are later excluded, users are required to reverify (allowing avoiding storing countries for specific wallets and potentially violating user privacy).
// The AccessManager restricts users from adding liquidity, adding collateral and borrowing USDS on the contract level - but always allows existing assets to be removed (in case a user's region is restricted after depositing assets).
//
// This contract can be replaced by the DAO with other mechanics such as decentralized ID services, KYC by region, or whatever else deemed necessary by the DAO to satisfy the changing regulatory landscape.
//
// Making proposals and voting is not access restricted - just in case AccessManager.sol is ever updated with a flaw in it that universally prevents access (which would effectively cripple the DAO if proposals and voting were then mistakingly restricted).
// Acquiring xSALT requires access though as the underlying staking mechanism requires access.
//
// Updateable using DAO.proposeSetContractAddress( "accessManager" )
